# Beyond Computer Science

I was born and raised in the heart of silicon valley, yet somehow I remained totally oblivious to the entire field of computer science until I travelled to a small college-town in the Berkshires. There, by chance, I became good friends with a CS major who was eager to share his newfound knowledge and excitement. 
As soon as I could understand what he was talking about, I became hooked. 4 years later, in those rare moments when I find myself not on a computer I greatly enjoy travelling (see above photos!), playing sports (especially Volleyball and Basketball), spending time outdoors (hiking, swimming, body surfing, etc...), and debating literature and philosphy (I've spent way too much time thinking about free will and responsibility).

A haphazard assortment of some of my thoughts on these latter areas lies below, although I make no claims about their accuracy, consistency or coherence.

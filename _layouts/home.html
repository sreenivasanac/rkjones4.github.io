# Welcome

Hi! My name is Kenny and I'm currently working at Facebook to help solve social good issues in the world using machine learning. 
My [team](http://facebook.com/fundraisers/) empowers people on Facebook to raise money for non profit and personal [causes](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/facebook-users-raised-300-million-in-birthday-donations.html) that they feel passionate about. 
Before joining Facebook, I double majored in [Computer Science](https://csci.williams.edu/) and [English Literature](https://english.williams.edu/) at the wonderful Williams College located in a distant corner of Massachussets.

Broadly, I'm interested in advancing the state of the art in machine learning applications through an improved understanding of the fundamental theory that underlies these systems. Some of the topics that especially excite me include deep learning, computer vision, generative networks, and model transparency/robustness. Check out the Projects tab for more detailed explanations of my past experiences with both industry and undergraduate research projects.

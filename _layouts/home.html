# Welcome!

I'm currently a machine learning engineer working in the Social Good organization at Facebook. 
Specifically I am part of the [charitable giving](http://facebook.com/fundraisers/) 
efforts and I use machine learning to empower people on Facebook to raise money 
for non-profit and personal causes that they care about. Before joining Facebook, I double majored in [Computer Science](https://csci.williams.edu/) and [English Literature](https://english.williams.edu/) at the wonderful Williams College.

My high-level interests center around machine learning, especially in both applications of computer vision and improving the robustness and transparency of deep learning models. 
My past academic research in machine learning has focused on deep generative networks (GANs) working mostly on image-based datasets. 
At Facebook, I build and improve large-scale production rankings models across a multitude of domains (News Feed, NLP, etc...) 

Check out the "Projects" tab for more detailed explanations of my past work.
